# Cloudy CSS
It's just a way for kids to pass the time. As far as I'm concerned, it's not a good thing.
## About
Thid CSS Framework is characterized by cloudy tints and rounded designs.
The curves and three-dimensionality, in keeping with the aesthetics of modern man, are adaptable to sites for all purposes.
## Install
No installation or anything else is required. 
Copy and paste the following code into the ```<head>``` of your HTML. 
As an explanation, the first three lines import the fonts and the fourth line imports the CSS itself.
```html 
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">   
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>   
 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&family=M+PLUS+Rounded+1c:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.github.com/himazin355/cloudy-css/cloudy.css">  
```
This code changes quite frequently. 
I'll notify you when it's changed, so please check back often.
## class
* ```<div class="header"></div>```

It's like a header underlay.
* ```<div class="header-logo"></div>```

It's like a header title.
* ```<div class="header-list"></div>```

It's the one that jumps to the subpage.
* ```<div class="contents-box"></div>```

It's a headline.
* ```<div class="contents"></div>```

I'm hoping to enclose one section with this, including the ```contents-box```.
But enclosing the top section might mess up the display.
* ```<div class="btn"></div>```

It's a button.
* ```<div class="footer"></div>```

It's a footer.
* ```<div class="main"></div>```

It's a main.
